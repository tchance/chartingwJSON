###Ditching the database for a faster JSON dataset

Done in my spare time at work in preparation for doing data graphics for the iPad, I also wanted to hone down the use of JSON datasets for graphic interpretation, seeing as how a database would prove completely unusable in an embedded HTML file.

Something I've always wanted to do, anyway.

A lot of these are the datasets I scraped off the Statistical Abstract's death data. The ones I used were accidents.js and chartingstuff.js.
